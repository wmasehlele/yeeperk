						“A business conceived in a job interview”
					<br/><br/>	
						Our founder Tshiamo Shomang, was in a job interview when he was told that he
						
						would not receive any benefits if he were to get the job. Knowing of the benefits
						
						that large companies offered their employees, he wanted to know why this
						
						company did not offer their employees any such benefits. The interviewer said
						
						that they are a small company and could not afford to offer benefits to
						
						their employees.
					<br/><br/>
						He got the job, investigated the matter and found that many that large
						
						organizations often get preferential rates in B2B transactions because of their
						
						large purchasing power. While small companies in South Africa could not access
						
						preferential rates in B2B transactions nor could they afford to offer their
						
						employees a range of employee benefits; this often results in low employee
						
						happiness and decreased employee retention rate which has a direct impact on
						
						the bottom line of a company.
					<br/><br/>	
						
						He started YeePerk to provide companies with an easy way to offer their staff an
						
						employee discount program and with an easy way to save thousands of Rand’s
						
						from notable B2B providers.
